    "In this capstone project I decided to utlize the Foursquare data to study the market for restaurants and service oriented small businesses in the Downtown Toronto area. For the analyses of this study, K-means clusterin is used the cluster the neighborhoods and amenities into clusters. The study explores the neighborhoods that currently have a higher concentration of restaurant businesses, and areas where there are opportunities for opening service oriented businesses."

    "An important aspect of determining the potential for new businesses in an area before investing into the place is to do market research. Market research helps businesses determine the potential strengths, opportunities, potential competition, and the likelihood of success when opening a new business when entering a new market. Until now most market research was conducted through data collected from questionaires and surveys. These data were then analyzed. However the emergence of data science and information technology, and the ability to access platforms such as foursquare that make such data available for research has helped in evolving this process of exploring a new market or area, a more scientific endeavor.\n",

    "In week 3 we learned in this class, how to use and access Foursquare data. As part of the week 3 assignment, we also segmented and clustered Toronto neightborhoods. So, it was determined that applying the foursquare data to compare the potential strengths, opportunities, and competition for opening new restaurants or small service oriented businesses in Toronto will be an interesing study. Therefore, I decided to pursue my analysis to examine the potential for opening restaurants and service oriented business by comparing different Toronto neighborhoods."
